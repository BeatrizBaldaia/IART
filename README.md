# IART

Resorting to genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to optimize the distribution of people and groups across dinner tables, taking into account some restrictions (such as group members have to stay in the same table, and the minimum and the maximum number of people per table) and factors (people's age, job, religion, and hobbies).

All the project details, and how to run it is presented in the document [iart-relatorio-final.pdf](https://github.com/BeatrizBaldaia/IART/blob/master/iart-relatorio-final.pdf) (however it is written in Portuguese).
